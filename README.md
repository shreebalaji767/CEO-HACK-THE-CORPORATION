# ExecutiveOS — CEO Simulator & Command Terminal

A responsive corporate satire game suite built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Designed for GitHub Pages: no build step, backend, account, or third-party dependencies required.

## Games and features

### CEO Simulator
- Company valuation, quarterly revenue and operating costs.
- Employee count, morale, synergy, brand reputation and market share.
- Strategic actions: meetings, hiring, rebranding, shareholder updates, AI-synergy theatre, product launches, wellbeing investment and competitor research.
- Advance quarters to settle the fictional books and trigger random market, investor, product or employee events with branching choices.
- Office upgrades, quarterly objectives, bankruptcy risk and New Game+ with a harder starting economy.
- Executive activity feed and unlockable achievements.

### CorpShell terminal
- Fictional commands including `help`, `status`, `whoami`, `scan`, `missions`, `finance`, `logs`, `daily`, `decrypt boardroom`, `quarterly prophecy`, `coffee`, `matrix` and `clear`.
- Six campaign objectives, fictional clearance progression, hidden messages, and a daily briefing reward.
- All terminal commands are harmless local simulations. They do not scan networks, access remote systems, or perform real security operations.

### Progress, settings and accessibility
- Browser-local autosave using `localStorage`; no account required.
- Three local save slots, JSON export/import, and New Game+.
- Premium corporate green/black theme plus light theme, optional synthesized sound cue, reduced-motion option, and keyboard shortcuts.
- Landing page navigation, logo-to-home behavior, responsive layout and custom SVG favicon.

## Run locally

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. No dependencies or server are needed.

## Publish with GitHub Pages

1. Open **Settings → Pages** in this repository.
2. Under **Build and deployment → Source**, select **GitHub Actions**.
3. Open the **Actions** tab and check the **Deploy ExecutiveOS to GitHub Pages** workflow.
4. After the workflow succeeds, use the site URL shown in **Settings → Pages**.

The workflow in `.github/workflows/pages.yml` publishes the static files from the repository root whenever changes are pushed to `main`. GitHub Pages must be enabled for the repository, and the workflow requires the repository's Pages/Actions permissions to allow deployment.

## Important notes

- Local saves are tied to the browser/device. Clearing browser storage or switching devices does not sync progress; export a save as a backup.
- Imported saves are validated for basic shape, but only import JSON files you trust.
- All company figures and outcomes are fictional and are not financial advice.
- Online accounts, cloud saves, and leaderboards are not included because this project intentionally remains static and backend-free.
